/* Black Card Revoked requires a minimum of three (3) people to play and a maximum of six. 
 * The game will ask for the number of players
 * The game will ask for the names of the players
 * 
 * The game will give the first question to each of the players that is multiple choice
 * The correct answer is revealed after each player gives their answer.
 * 
 * Round 2 of the game will start with Player 2. 
 * The multiple choice answers are given then the following rotation ensues: 
 * Player2 Answer, Player3, Player last, and returns to Player 1. 
 * 
 * Black Card Revoked is played until at least everyone goes one full round going first
 * and leaves an option to either CONTINUE (the game) or END (the game). 
 * 
 * Points are tallied at the final round and the winner is the one that has the most points.
 * If there are multiple players with the same number of points, TIE will be returned as the result.
