# How To Play

Black Card Revoked requires a minimum of three people to play and a maximum of six.

The game will ask for the number of players and then ask for the names of the players. The game will give the first question to each of the players that is multiple choice.

Player 1 will answer first in Round 1 and the remaining players will go after them. For example: Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, etc. until the last person plays.

After each player gives their answer, the correct answer is revealed and everyone who is correct receives a point.

Round 2: The question is given and the first person to reply is Player 2. For example, the multiple choice answers are given and then: Player 2 answers, Player 3, Player last, Player 1.

Black Card Revoke is played in this order until at least everyone goes one round first. There is then an option to continue the game or save the game.

Participants have 6-10 seconds to answer. After 6-10 seconds, your answer choices will be revealed. If the choice is blank then a point of zero (0) will be given to that player.

Tally up the points at the final round and the winner is the one that has the most points. If any one player has the same number of points, a tie will be displayed.

There are 81 questions and 24 responses.
